  },
  {
    "prompt": "Experiments make me anxious. How can I participate without feeling overwhelmed?",
    "response": "Let's break down the experiment into smaller steps and go through them one at a time. We can also create a quiet, designated space for you to observe or participate in the experiment at your own pace.",
    "educational_strategy_used": "Structured Learning",
    "application": "Providing a calm and predictable environment for participating in scientific experiments, reducing anxiety and enhancing engagement."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How can I understand chemical reactions without getting confused?",
    "response": "We can use simple, everyday materials for safe chemical reactions, like baking soda and vinegar. Watching these react and writing down what happens step by step will help you grasp the concept of chemical reactions more clearly.",
    "educational_strategy_used": "Sequential Instruction",
    "application": "Using sequential steps and real-world examples to demystify chemical reactions, facilitating easier understanding."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Why do we need to learn about atoms if we can't see them?",
    "response": "Think of atoms as the building blocks of everything, like LEGO. We may not see them, but understanding how they work helps us know more about the world. Let's use LEGO to build models representing atoms and molecules.",
    "educational_strategy_used": "Analogy and Modeling",
    "application": "Comparing atoms to familiar objects and using models to represent them, aiding in conceptual understanding."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "I find it hard to follow experiments in class. Can we do something different?",

    "educational_strategy_used": "Comic Strip Sequences",
    "application": "Transforming experiment instructions into a visual comic strip format to simplify and clarify the process for autistic students."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "The noise during group activities is too much for me. How can I learn in a quieter way?",
    "response": "We can arrange for you to participate in smaller groups or one-on-one sessions where it's quieter. We'll also use headphones with calming music or noise cancellation when a quiet space isn't available.",
    "educational_strategy_used": "Sensory Adaptation",
    "application": "Adjusting the learning environment to manage sensory sensitivities, ensuring a comfortable and conducive setting for education."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "I'm interested in science, but reading textbooks is hard for me. Any suggestions?",
