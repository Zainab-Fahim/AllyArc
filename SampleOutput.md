# The Rainbow Project: supporting pre-school children

Published on 07 April 2017

Author: Amanda Haydock

**Amanda Haydock discusses The Rainbow Project, a specialist, supportive
environment for pre-school autistic children. She explains why she set the
project up and outlines the approaches they use to develop communication,
social and play skills.**

It all started with one little girl. I was working as a support worker at the
time, and I used to spend six hours a week with her. She was four-and-a-half
when we began, and she taught me so much about autism, teaching, and life in
general. She was very quiet, with very little interaction, virtually no eye
contact, and no ability to sit still!

Gradually, though, over a period of about three years, we've developed a
relationship and through that relationship she has grown so much. She now
can't get enough of people, she loves to interact, and she has some hard-won
skills that will help her throughout her life (such as dressing, going to the
toilet, and eating a non-beige diet), as well as academic and concentration
skills.

Through her, and many others whom I have worked with, I learned about visual
schedules, PECS, the TEACCH method, and Intensive Interaction, and I developed
a love of reaching these kids in whatever way works for them.

I learned about early intervention and realised how important it is to reach
children on the autism spectrum as early as possible. The aim is to hopefully
improve their communication, social, and play skills so that their level of
frustration and anxiety is as low as possible and they will grow to be
effective learners and self-advocates.

I realised that there was very little support for very young children on the
autism spectrum in the local area. I set my sights on a nursery, and
registered myself and my home with Ofsted. I christened it "The Rainbow
Project" and have been providing 1:1 autism-specific intervention and support
for children aged 2-5 since November 2015. I also started a Master's degree in
Autism at the University of Birmingham in September that year.

## The methods I use

I am using mixed methods, but my main focus is on the DIR/Floortime approach
along with other developmental methods such as Intensive Interaction. I also
use a TEACCH approach and the environment is structured to provide lots of
opportunities to communicate, as well as the methods to do so (primarily
through the use of PECS). For each child, I create individual learning goals
(in the form of an IEP) in collaboration with the child's parents; we then
work on these goals for 6-12 weeks and when they are achieved more are
created.

**DIR/Floortime**

The DIR approach puts sensory and emotional regulation at its heart, stating
that a child must be regulated before a child can engage with the world around
them. I have a trampoline, peanut ball, large spinning bowl, swing, and other
equipment which I use with the children to help them receive sensory input
before I expect them to engage with me. One little boy, for example, used to
wander around the room without engaging with toys or with me; since I began
using sensory strategies (the trampoline and weighted vest especially) his
attention span has increased and he is more willing to interact with me.

**TEACCH**

Almost all of the children are using a visual schedule, some completely
independently and others in a now-and-next-type format. For those for whom it
is appropriate, it helps reduce anxiety and provide structure, enabling them
to learn more effectively. Each child also has a work box with structured work
tasks, working on skills from their IEP.

**Intensive Interaction**

One little boy was quite isolated and did not interact with the adults around
him except to pull them to things and scream or cry. Through the use of
Intensive Interaction, this little boy has gone from not noticing if someone
was in the room with him, to actively seeking them out to play!

**Use of PECS**

PECS has been used effectively with almost all of the children. One little
girl could speak, but did not use any speech to communicate. Now, through the
use of PECS, she is starting to say the words along with pointing to the
pictures. Another little boy used PECS in the same way, and now speaks non-
stop!

## Debrief with parents/carers

Every session ends with a debrief with the parents where I tell them about the
Wow! moments (of which there are plenty) and provide the space for them to
troubleshoot any issues they're having, as well as showing them how to use the
methods too, which I think they really appreciate. I attend meetings with
parents, write reports, and am constantly thinking about the next steps for
all the children.

Since it started, the project has gone from strength to strength, gaining more
children and more recognition by the month. I currently serve eight families,
and the amount of progress the children have made is remarkable.

## Examples of progress

Thomas'  imaginative play has gone from three or four different actions to
multi-step and highly creative. He now notices and reacts with real empathy
when I try to hide my proud cry, is affectionate and emotionally connected in
a way he wasn't before, and he invites me joyfully into his play.

Lily has gone from no functional communication to verbally joining in with
songs, using PECS (often saying the words), being excited about people, and
gaining independence.

Jamie has gone from totally non-verbal to using two-word combinations, having
emerging joint attention skills, playing and making up stories with small
characters, and has positive attention-seeking behaviours (all in 5 months!)

I love the work that I do and I feel privileged to be a part of these
children's and families' journeys.

# Limpsfield Grange School: teaching autistic girls

Published on 09 December 2016

Author: Sarah Wild

**Sarah Wild, Headteacher at Limpsfield Grange School, discusses how autism
presents in girls and how they support autistic pupils at the school,
particularly with managing anxiety. She also gives us her top 5 tips on
educating autistic girls.**

Limpsfield Grange School in Surrey is a residential secondary special school
for girls with social communication and interaction needs. The majority of our
girls are autistic, and what's really different about our school is the fact
that it's a community where autistic girls are in the majority.

In the last five years there's been an increased awareness in the medical
profession that autistic girls present very differently to boys, with anxiety
being an over-riding emotion. Being diagnosed as autistic and accessing
support can be difficult, as there are still GPs who say to parents 'Your
daughter can't be on the spectrum because she can make conversation and eye
contact.'

But lots of autistic girls can do exactly that. Many of them don't understand
what's going on socially but they want to make conversation, while not
understanding its subtext. The stereotype of an autistic person being locked
into themselves and obsessive doesn't necessarily apply to girls, who are
reaching out and trying to socially engage with other people.

At Limpsfield Grange we believe there needs to be much better awareness of
what autism in girls and women looks like. We know that just because the girls
aren't obsessed with Thomas the Tank Engine or lining things up in neat rows
doesn't mean they are not on the spectrum. Just because they can make eye
contact, have a reciprocal conversation with someone for five minutes doesn't
mean they are not autistic. It means the girls have learned how to have a
conversation. Society needs to redefine what it thinks autism is.

## Raising awareness

We believe that our community has part to play in raising awareness of female
autism. The girls, along with author Vicky Martin, have written two novels
about an autistic girl, M in the Middle and M is for Autism. Both novels allow
the reader to view the world through the anxiety-ridden eyes of an autistic
girl called M.  We also made a documentary with ITV called Girls with Autism
to try and show people what it is really like to be an autistic teenage girl.

The girls really want to tell people what it's like to be autistic and to help
others. They've spent a long time feeling really alone and don't want other
girls to feel as isolated. They're proud of their coolness and quirkiness and
want other kids to feel part of a cool community.

## Copying behaviours

At Limpsfield Grange we call it social formatting: copying and pasting someone
else's behaviour and trying to make it your own - without understanding where
that comes from. This can lead to serious problems. It's mentally exhausting
to continually supresses your natural social reactions. In places like school
or college or work autistic women and girls are often surrounded by people who
really don't get them. They have to mask their difficulties all day.

This is why understanding, regulating and managing their emotions is
absolutely crucial to autistic girls' happiness in adult life. It is key to
feeling well, happy and together and to accessing opportunities. It's the
difference between being a contained, emotionally functioning adult, or being
stranded in their bedroom by their anxiety.

## Anxiety

Managing and living well with anxiety is a fundamental strand of the work that
we do here. When they first come to the school at age 11, the girls quite
often lack self-awareness when it comes to their emotional range, and can't
identify what makes them anxious. They don't really understand what they feel
or how their feelings impact on their behaviour.

Working with the girls to recognise, label and manage their emotional
responses is a long process. We work with them to link physical sensations
with emotions and then work backwards to identify triggers for those emotions.

Once the girls understand why certain situations make them feel a certain way
we can work with them to develop strategies to manage their emotional
responses.  This process can take months but once the girls understand why
they feel the way they do, it can be incredibly empowering for them.

We hope that by enabling the girls to understand and manage their anxiety, and
through raising awareness in society about female autism, we can equip them to
lead the most successful lives they can.

## Top 5 tips on educating autistic girls

  1. Build a relationship. Relationships are crucial to autistic girls - they need to feel accepted by you, and that you understand them.
  2. Make learning concrete, contextual and visual.
  3. Ask them how they would like to be supported in social situations -girls will want to engage with others socially but may find this overwhelming or confusing.
  4. Build in quiet space and time each day where the girls can process their thoughts and feelings without being socially "on show." Remember that masking all day is exhausting.
  5. Create some bespoke sex and relationships lessons. Autistic girls may have multiple vulnerabilities including:

  * they want to please people
  * they are sociable without understanding context
  * they are concrete literal thinkers
  * they can be very trusting
  * low self-esteem.

Check understanding of situations and terminology and make these sessions
student-led so you are addressing gaps in their knowledge.

# Teaching secondary school autistic students

Published on 06 March 2018

Author: Lynn McCann

**Lynn McCann is an Autism Specialist teacher, trainer and author. Here Lynn
gives us her top five tips on teaching autistic students in secondary school,
taken from her latest book "How to support students with autism spectrum
conditions in secondary schools".**

Secondary teachers may have 120 or more students coming through their lessons
every day. Sometimes they meet students only once a week and others they may
see every day. Below are some general tips for secondary teachers to help them
support autistic students.

Please note that it is very important to recognise that not every autistic
student will be the same. Each student is unique and has their own strengths
and difficulties - getting to know and understand them will be your biggest
reward.  

## Top 5 tips

### 1\. Read the information from the SENCO

This may seem like obvious advice but it is easy to feel overwhelmed by the
amount of information given to you by the Special Educational Needs
Coordinator (SENCO). If they have a one page profile of the student with
Special Educational Needs or Disabilities (SEND), then this will be your most
useful document. It should include:

  * what the student may struggle with
  * what strategies help them most
  * what should be avoided
  * what the student's interests are and any other useful information. 

Use the strategies that have been recommended.  For example an autistic
student might need extra time to process instructions or may need them broken
down into smaller tasks. Using strategies that work will help you build up a
good relationship with the student, who will then develop trust in you. Don't
wait until the first sign of your usual strategies going wrong (which may be
very quickly apparent) before you try those recommended by the SENCO.  

### 2\. Make learning accessible

Ask the student where they will be most comfortable sitting in the classroom.
The environment and fellow students can be overstimulating for the autistic
students' senses and so getting the seating position right can make all the
difference. Avoid changing seating plans without consulting them first -
change can cause huge anxiety.

Give instructions in lists, breaking down the task into manageable chunks.  If
the student finds open-ended questions difficult then make it more concrete
for them to begin with, or provide them with some vocabulary, structure or
ideas.  Executive functioning, the brains ability to organise, plan, predict
and monitor, can be an area of difficulty for some autistic students.

Give autistic students time to process information and don't put them on the
spot by asking questions publicly, unless you know that they are comfortable
with this. Prepare them for what is coming and if you are relying on a
teaching assistant (TA) to do this, make sure the TA can also see a copy of
your lesson plan.

Use visuals and structured tasks, incorporating the student's own interests
wherever possible.  Verbal information is fleeting and the person has to
remember it whilst working out what they should do with it. Some autistic
students cannot follow the fast pace of verbal information so backing it up
with a written account, list or picture can help enormously. Other autistic
students have excellent verbal memories but may find it difficult to apply
that information to another situation, and may need support to do this.

### 3\. Homework

Well we have to tackle this topic in a secondary school!  Homework is
difficult for many autistic students for a number of reasons. Most commonly
they are exhausted after school.  The energy they use just coping throughout
the day is far more than most other students and so there may be nothing left
in the bank to do homework as well.  

Some autistic students may have rigid thoughts about school is school and home
is home, and may find it difficult to understand why they need to do
schoolwork at home.  

Often the biggest difficulties for autistic students is understanding how to
do the homework.  If the teacher has explained it to the class in a way that
the autistic student cannot understand, then they will not be able to do it.
This can lead to a lot of distress at home.

There are a number of things you can do to help, including:

  * Print the homework off on a sticky label and put that in the student's planner.
  * Email the parents so they know what the homework is. 
  * Differentiate the homework so that it is something related to the student's interests or involves less writing.
  * Teach the student how to use speech to text technology in Word or other programmes so there is less writing.
  * Support them to do the homework in school homework clubs.
  * …or give them less homework, especially in KS3.  Build it up slowly and make it successful. 

### 4\. Understanding behaviour

All teachers want a class of calm and alert students who want to learn.
Autistic students can be the quietest and most compliant students in the
class.  If a student does present 'behaviour that challenges', it is important
to remember that this is often communicating a need or difficulty.

Remember to stop and think. Ask yourself the following questions and then work
out a way to support the student better:

  * Do they understand what I mean?
  * Are they struggling with their peers?
  * Are they overloaded with sensory sensations?
  * Are they worried, anxious, fearful? 
  * Do they know how to organise that task?

You may need help from the SENCO but a positive approach makes all the
difference.

### 5\. Have high expectations

Read subject specific advice about teaching autistic students, get to know the
students you teach and build a positive relationship with them. Encourage
shared interests with other students, as shared interests often make the best
friendships.

Autistic students can thrive and achieve in secondary school.  They may need
adaptations, a different approach some of the time and a lot of kindness and
understanding. Many autistic students can go on to further and higher
education, have jobs and families. Assume they will do something in life that
they are interested in, and that you can help them get there.

I want to leave you with an example of an autistic student who was interested
in where all the pipes and wires were laid around the school.  The school gave
him a session a week with the Design Technology (DT) technician and built that
into his support programme. The student struggled with English and other text
based lessons but thrived in DT, IT and practical lessons.  This boy went on
to be an electrician because the school helped him into an apprenticeship that
supported and understood him.  We can help all our autistic students thrive.

[DEBUG]: Working Agent: Data Processing Specialist

[INFO]: Starting Task: 

 Transform the raw data collected by the Data Scraping Agent into a structured, modular format to support the creation of a detailed chatbot dataset. Each piece of data should be formatted as follows, focusing on singular, actionable strategies:
{
  ```
  {
  "educational_strategy": "individual strategy",
  "application": "detailed application in an educational or mentorship setting"
  }
  ```
**Objective:**
- Present each educational strategy and its application in a modular, concise format. This will serve as a foundational input for the Data Creation Agent, who is tasked with generating twenty unique prompts and responses for each strategy.

**Guidelines:**
1. Ensure each entry is focused on a single educational strategy, avoiding generalizations or combinations of strategies.
2. Detail the application of each strategy in educational or mentorship settings, providing clear, actionable guidance.
3. Prioritize clarity and specificity in describing how the strategy can be implemented, facilitating the Data Creation Agent in generating diverse and relevant responses.

By adhering to these guidelines, you will contribute to building a comprehensive, structured dataset that enhances the chatbot’s ability to assist autistic students effectively.

[INFO]: Starting Task: 
  Objective: Construct a dataset for a chatbot that facilitates dialogues between autistic students and educators or mentors. This dataset is crucial for simulating realistic interactions focused on academic subjects, social interactions, and personal growth.

  Dataset Entry Format:
  ```
  {
  "prompt": "text",
  "response": "text",
  "educational_strategy_used": "single strategy",
  "application": "specific context"
  }
  ```

**Task Requirements:**
- **Prompt Generation**: Create prompts that reflect authentic inquiries or comments from autistic students across a broad spectrum of topics. These prompts should embody the communication styles and needs unique to autistic students.

- **Response Creation**: For each educational strategy provided by the Data Formatting Agent, you are tasked with generating twenty unique, supportive, and clear responses. Each response should be tailored to the student's query, utilizing the specified educational strategy in a way that is both supportive and personalized.

- **Explicit Requirement**: It is imperative to generate a minimum of **twenty unique JSON objects for each educational strategy**. This means you will create twenty distinct prompts and corresponding responses for every single strategy provided, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive dataset.

**Execution Strategy:**
1. Identify various scenarios or questions an autistic student might have relating to each educational strategy.
2. Develop twenty unique prompts for each strategy, ensuring a wide range of topics and situations are covered.
3. Craft a tailored response for each prompt, applying the educational strategy in a supportive and context-specific manner.

The goal of this task is to amass a rich, varied dataset that empowers the chatbot to offer realistic, educational, and supportive interactions for autistic students.
